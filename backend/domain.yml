  utter_ask_exchange_conditions:
  - text: "Esprit University offers international mobility opportunities through  
     semester exchanges and double-degree programs. Students receive emails from  
     the Mobility Office (mobilite-internationale@esprit.tn) with application links.  

     To be eligible, students typically need to complete at least 4 semesters,  
     maintain a good academic standing (average requirement varies by partner university),  
     and submit an application form with required documents, such as:  
     - Passport  
     - ID card  
     - Transcripts  
     - Learning agreement  

     Selection is based on academic performance and host university requirements.  
     Would you like details about specific universities or deadlines?"

  # Passport Requirement
  utter_ask_passport_requirement:
  - text: "It is recommended to have a valid passport before applying for an exchange.  
     However, some universities allow students to submit their application first  
     and provide the passport later. Please check the specific requirements in  
     the email sent by the Mobility Office (mobilite-internationale@esprit.tn)."
